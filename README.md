Running the Jupyter Notebook

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python (version 3.x recommended)
Jupyter Notebook (you can also use Jupyter Lab)
Any additional packages or libraries required by the .ipynb file (often specified in the file or a requirements.txt file)

Installing Jupyter Notebook
If you haven't installed Jupyter Notebook, you can do so using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install notebook
Alternatively, if you use conda:

bash
Copy code
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
Running the Notebook
Open a terminal/command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the .ipynb file.
Use cd path/to/your/notebook/directory to change directories.

Start Jupyter Notebook by running:

bash
Copy code

This will open a new tab in your default web browser displaying the Jupyter Notebook interface.

Locate and open the desired .ipynb file by clicking on it in the Jupyter Notebook interface or directly open it from Google Colab

Running Cells in the Notebook
